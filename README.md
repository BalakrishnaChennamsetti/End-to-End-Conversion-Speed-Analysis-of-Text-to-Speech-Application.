# End-to-End-Conversion-Speed-Analysis-of-Text-to-Speech-Application.
The development of automated responding systems (i.e., chatbot, voicebot) has enabled the extensive use of speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) systems. In this project, an FPT-based text-to-speech (TTS) application is developed that converts Vietnamese text into spoken words. The FPT stands for Financing and Promoting Technology. The application is developed based on Django for Python and in the form of an interactive web page which is connected to an FPT.AI server through its application programming interface (API).
